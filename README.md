# Phoebe

Pheobe is an automated trust and safety agent that performs automated actions on the ATProtocol network. Phoebe interfaces with various tools
which allow it to detect, alert, and resolve emerging safety threats.

Phoebe interfaces with the following tools:

- [Ozone](https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone)
- [Osprey](https://github.com/roostorg/osprey)
- [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/)

Phoebe can be used with Anthropic, OpenAI, and OpenAPI-compatible model APIs.

## Usage

TBD. Right now, you can talk to the agent through `uv run main.py chat` and ask for assistance with Osprey-related tasks.
